Week 8 | Feb 15-21 | Numbers 21 - Deut 4

These chapters reveal the beginning of God’s work and the root of human life and sin. As you read, approach the Word slowly, reverently, and prayerfully.

Do not read just to finish but to listen.
Pause, reflect, and allow God to speak through His Word.

Deep Bible reading is not about remembering great events, but about noticing the human heart-conditions hidden within small verses

Rules & Regulations:

      1.Every Sunday, a Bible portion and a question will be sent to you.

      2.Your answer must be submitted with appropriate Scripture references.

      3.Your response must be sent on or before Saturday 11PM of each week.

      4.Late submissions will not be accepted.

      5.If more than one member from the same family joins this Bible reading group, each person should read the Bible individually and find their own answers.
